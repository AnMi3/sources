There FPGAmstrada has some limited SD card support. 
You can place the DSK files on the SD root and with a 
"CAT" command check the first that was mounted. With 
"Page Up" key, the CPC resets and the next DSK is mounted.  (CS+SS+J in gomados+)

Load the disks with 

RUN"xxxxx

Where xxxxx is the name showed on CAT command.
